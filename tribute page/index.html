                    Cobain's best known song is the grunge anthem, "Smells like teen spirit." Behind that song is a story: Kathleen Hanna, a friend of Cobain, wrote on the wall of her room "Kurt smells like Teen Spirit", alluding to the Teen Spirit deodorant worn by Kurt's girlfriend at the time, Tobi Vail. Kurt did not understand the joke and interpreted the phrase with a revolutionary meaning.
